# FortranShuttleProject

This contains original Fortran 90 code I wrote for Math 448 at James Madison University in 2007.  

The folder [fortranSrc](fortranSrc) has the original unmodified Fortran code I wrote for the project.

The folder [dotnetSrc](dotnetSrc) has GitHub Copilot generated code that converted the Fortran 90 code into C# code.

Below is a sample scatter plot showing the output of this solution,
