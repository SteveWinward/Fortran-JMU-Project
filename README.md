# FortranShuttleProject

This contains original Fortran 90 code I wrote for Math 448 at James Madison University in 2007.  

The folder directly ````fortranSrc```` has the Fortran code I wrote for the project.

The folder ````dotnetSrc```` has GitHub Copilot generated code that converted the Fortran 90 code into C# code.

I also used GitHub Copilot to generated ASCII art of a NASA inspired Shuttle and a scatter plot of the numerical results.
